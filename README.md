# Psychrometric Tables

As I was in the process of studying for the Mechanical Engineering PE
exam, I found that looking up values on the Psychrometric chart not only
was a waste of precious time, but also a chance for silly mistakes by
not reading the values precisely.

After thinking about it for some time, I wondered why there were no
texts or reference material with all of these calculations completed for
sea-level pressure. It does turn out that there are quite a few
permutations of tables that one may need.

What I decided was that I needed to look up properties given dry-bulb
temperature and one of the three other common pairs.

1. Wet bulb temperature
2. Relative humidity
3. Dew point temperature

I made the grid size for the tables small enough that it would hardly
be necessary to interpolate more precisely than just taking half the
difference.

## Customizing

The table values were created using python, and so if you'd like to
create a slightly different version of this, you can.
